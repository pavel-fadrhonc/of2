My Additions to Extenject framework.
These are considered **Extras** since they do not neccesarilly extend the base functionality, same as original Extenject extras like [Signals](https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject/blob/master/Documentation/Signals.md), [Async](https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject/blob/master/Documentation/Async.md), etc...
